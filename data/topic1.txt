Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence focuses on building systems that can perform tasks 
requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning,
pattern recognition, and decision-making. It includes areas like
machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.
AI is used to analyze large datasets, automate complex processes, and
support intelligent decision-making across industries such as healthcare, finance, and education.
