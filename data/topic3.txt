Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology is a decentralized system for recording 
and verifying transactions across multiple nodes without 
relying on a central authority. It ensures data integrity through cryptography, 
immutability, and consensus mechanisms. Blockchain is widely used in cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, 
supply chain tracking, and secure data sharing where transparency and trust are essential.
